Operation of the program


This program is for designers and is made to shorten the time of product and system design.
It also makes good use of time taken to increase the efficiency of the product or system.
In order to do so the program must perform certain tasks in a specific manner.
These tasks are as follows: A list of material from a database is presented to the user.
The user can choose two or more of the material from the database.
The program then performs the necessary calculations on the material to determine whether the material chosen were a good match.
It then searches for similar material with same characteristics but better for efficiency.
Once efficiency is confirmed it goes through a different set of senarios for its operation performance in that condition.
Once it has all the information it is then made known to the user.
