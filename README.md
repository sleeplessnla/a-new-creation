# a-new-creation
this project aims at creating program that helps the designer to shorten the process of designing new and more efficient energy systems.
things to consider in this program are things such as material used, calculations used in determing the best material to use,database range of the type of material, effectiveness of the material, what other material may have a negative effect on material used that determines whether or not it would chemically bond,.....
this software must be able to make calculations based on a number of questions and then a selection of the material is made from the database.
once the material is selected the calculations are automatically made. (Affects from other aspects are included in the 
the end user will have the option of selecting other material with similar aspects for a better output or staying with the initial selection.
once the choice is made the material along with its qualities are made known to the user.
material choices are a list of material that is to be exported from matweb.
the most material choices should be the max amount of material that can be exported from matweb and imported into the program
the material should be of different characteristic types for program future expansion
