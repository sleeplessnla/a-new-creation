# a-new-creation
this project aims at creating program that helps the designer to shorten the process of designing new and more efficient solar systems.
things to consider in this program are things such as material used, calculations used in determing the best material to use,database range of the type of material, effectiveness of the material, what other material may have a negative effect on material used that determines whether or not it would chemically bond,
this software must be able to make calculations based on a number of questions and then a selection of the material is made from the database
once the material is selected the calculatioons are automatically made.
